# Business Card Etiquette
Here are a few tips on what to do and what not to do with your business card at networking events.

## Rule #1:
Keep your business card to yourself. DO NOT hand out your business card to everyone you see as if you are passing out $20 bills. Have you ever had someone come up to you while you are talking to someone else and slip a business card in your hand and keep moving.

Not only is it distracting, especially if the two people are making a great connection, it is also annoying. It’s the equivalent to receiving junk mail at your house. Unless you asked for information about the Tremble 3500 vacuum cleaner, chances are you are not going to joyfully read the advertisement that came in the mail – especially if you are as busy as most of us are.

You ask: But shouldn’t the goal be to get my name and contact info in front of as many people as possible?

Answer: Yes, and that is what advertising is for. Get a billboard, take out an ad, get a web page. Do not fool yourself into thinking that you successfully networked with a hundred people because you handed out a hundred business cards.

One of the goals of networking is to identify qualified leads, potential employers or referral sources. That doesn’t mean that you don’t meet and talk to people outside of those targets. But it does mean you are selective about who you choose to exchange information with.

## Rule #2: 
Give your business card to someone when they ask for it. If I am interested in connecting with someone beyond an event, I will ask for a way to contact them. Notice that I did not say I will give them my card or give them my contact information. Why? If I give them my card, I have no control over whether they will contact me or not. If I get their information I have access to follow up with a phone call, via e-mail, or by connecting through their website. Passing out my card to 20 people does not mean that I will get 20 calls. But acquiring contact information of 20 people guarantees that I will have 20 people to add to my follow-up list.

Quick Tip: When someone ask for your business card, write a note on the back of it before you hand it over. It could be a note about what you talked about, a reminder about why they asked for your information. Something that jogs their memory as they go through the sea of cards they have in their collection.

##  Rule #3: 
Don’t waste contact information. Why take someone’s card if you are not going to follow up. Send an e-mail. Make a quick call. Send them a physical card. But do something to capitalize on the meeting. This doesn’t have to be complicated. You could send out an e-mail blast, blind carbon copy (BCC) only, giving your contacts an update on what you are doing. This goes for entrepreneurs and careerist. Entrepreneurs can send updates about new products or developments in their business. Professionals can send out industry relevant information and tips.

You ask: But can’t I just keep the card in case I need the service later?

Answer: Yes you can. But it seems more likely and more wise that if you needed a service from someone you didn’t already have in your network that you would ask someone you know for a referral rather than choosing a random card from your stack. Don’t make the assumption that just because you have their card, that the business or individual is a part of your network – especially if you have no experience with the quality of their work. One of the quickest ways to ruin your reputation is to make bad referrals.

**The take away:**

Keep your business card to yourself until someone asks for it.
Only ask for cards or contact information for people you intend to follow up with.
Make the most of your networking by regularly connecting with your contacts.
