# LinkedIn Branding

## Introduction
- LinkedIn is indispensable for overall career management and job searching. 
- LinkedIn is NOT facebook.
- Worlds largest networking site. (Think of it as a virtual Rolodex.)
- Built on the idea of "Six degrees of separation" which is the idea that we all are Six or fewer steps away from each other so that a "friend of a friend" can be made to connect any two people in a maximum of Six steps.
- 90% of companies are using LinkedIn data in the hiring process.

##  Building Your Profile & Network
- Start with your resume and build your profile with consistent branding to ensure you will be found by employers looking for professionals with your skill set.
- Your linkedIn profile is NOT your resume. 
- Enhance the quality of contacts and increase the speed of finding the right contacts.

## Creating a Strategic Network
The size and strength of your network directly affects your access to people and information within LinkedIn.

As you build your network, add a variety of contacts, including those you know from past employers, associations, schools, volunteer organizations, and your personal network. Your overall network will grow rapidly with each 1st degree connection you add. This is due to the fact that you will also be gaining access to each of your 1st degree connections’ personal networks (now your 2nd degree connections) and the networks of each of those people (now your 3rd degree connections). 

The power of LinkedIn often lies in your 2nd degree connections as this group is exponentially larger than your immediate network, and access to them is only an introduction away.  

# Research Strategies
## Leveraging Groups 
Joining and participating in some of LinkedIn’s almost one million groups is an important, but often overlooked, way to network, expand your reach, and get noticed on the site.

Want free messaging access to others on LinkedIn? Join a group that they are in! One of LinkedIn’s greatest gems is the free messaging it makes available between group members. 

Want greater visibility to recruiters? Join the career groups for your target companies and be an active contributor. And, get noticed by recruiters in non-company groups by participating in discussions or sending them a message. Don’t forget to keep track of the group job board also. 

Want to follow the activity of group members without adding them to your network? Select the ‘follow’ option next to interesting fellow members to be notified of their activity within the group. This can include jobs they post or discussions they start. 

Because LinkedIn limits you to membership in 50 groups at a time, join a variety of groups to create a combination of wide reach and niche visibility. Some examples of groups to join are: specialty or certification groups, job seeker groups, local groups, company career groups, and alumni or professional groups.

### Watch the conversation before jumping in!
Most online networking sites and forums have their own policies, procedures, and rules of engagement. When you first join a site, take some time to watch the interaction before offering opinions, uploading content, and engaging others. Once you understand the flow of dialogue, you'll be better able to contribute to the community in a positive way.

## Find people in a company
Search for a company name:

* Will show you 1st and 2nd level connections
* Clicking on a person at the company and then selecting the company from their profile will bring up the company page.
* Follow the company and see their postings and job listings.

## Advanced Search
Once you have run a search on a person or company there will be an option _"All Filters"_ that provides access to advanced search features:

* You can search for people that worked at a previous company to their current company. 
* You can see where people have typically gone from your company pervious company.
* Search by Location
* Search by Industry
* Search by Schools
