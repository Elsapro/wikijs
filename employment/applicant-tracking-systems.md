# (ATS) What Are They?
-  An applicant tracking system (ATS) is a software application that enables the electronic handling of recruitment needs. ... In many cases they filter applications automatically based on given criteria such as keywords, skills, former employers, years of experience and schools attended.

## How do applicant tracking systems work?
-   Applicant tracking systems process resumes submitted by applicants and sometimes even use social media to actively recruit prospective employees. When you submit your resume through an ATS, it stores your resume and an entry in the database. The recruiters then search for keywords for the particular job opening. When you apply for a job online, your resume isn’t typically going directly to a recruiter or hiring manager. It’s first being processed by an ATS. Whether that human recruiter ever sees your resume could depend on how well your resume is optimized for ATS algorithms.

##  Why employers use applicant tracking systems
-  Top employers hire for several jobs at a time and receive hundreds of resumes for any given opening. Because applying for a job online is easier than ever, many of these applicants are unqualified and figured “it was worth a try.”

Applicant tracking systems keep all these resumes in one place, helping recruiters and hiring managers stay organized as well as EEOC compliant. In theory, these systems also save time by automatically surfacing and highlighting top candidates. In reality, ATS do help hiring professionals narrow their applicant pool, but top candidates slip through the cracks.

## Keyword Searches
-  A common way recruiters filter resumes in an applicant tracking system is by searching for key skills and titles.

For example, if a recruiter is hiring for an Administrative Assistant position out of 400 resumes, their first step will probably be a search for “Administrative Assistant.” This will isolate candidates that have done the exact job before. Anyone that doesn’t have that exact term in their resume is out of luck.

A search can contain multiple terms. For example, they might perform a complex search that contains a combination of titles and skills important for the job:

Administrative Assistant AND data entry AND payroll …

Candidates who can predict the correct resume keywords will have the greatest chance of being included in recruiter search results. The best way figure out which skills and keywords to include is by analyzing the job description.

Jobscan automates this process by analyzing your resume against the job description to show the top skills and keywords missing from your resume.

## Resume formatting matters in applicant tracking systems
-  When you upload your resume into an applicant tracking system, the recruiter won’t necessarily view the file. Some ATS parse the document into a digital profile to make things uniform and searchable.

This causes big problems for job seekers.

Many ATS parsing algorithms are outdated and unintelligent, causing your resume information to get distorted or lost. This means vital keywords or details might not be imported. Imagine your most important qualification slipping through the cracks!

Modern ATS are starting to get away from this practice, but some popular systems like iCIMS (used by Amazon, General Mills, Comcast) still do it. In order to create an ATS-friendly resume that is parsable by these outdated systems, be sure to keep section headings simple, use consistent formatting for your work history and dates, avoid tables, and use a .docx or .pdf file format.

##  How to “beat” applicant tracking systems
-  There is no universal trick to beating applicant tracking systems. Surviving an ATS and getting invited for a job interview requires well-written resume that is mindful of ATS algorithms as well as the people pushing the buttons.


This includes:
*  Carefully tailoring your resume for each and every job you apply to
*  Dirrectly addressing qualifications found in the job description
*  Increasing searchability by adding resume keywords based on the job description
*  Focusing on the most impactful information in your work experience section
*  Keeping your resume formatting simple so that an ATS can accurately parse it
