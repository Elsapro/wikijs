# Resume Writing Strategies & Guidelines
## Overview
* You reume isn't your "job history" but the part of your job hisotry that is selling you into the role you're targeting.
* Resume reviewers spend less than 10-seconds reciewing a document. A trong personal branding statement helps you quickly get to your messaging.

## Voice & Tense
You are the writer of the resume. That means the resume is written in 1st person, never in 3rd person.

**Example:**
* Correct: Imporved accuracy of cash reporting by 50%
* Incorrect: ~~Improves accurarcy of cash reporting by 50%~~

## Length
Resumes shiould ideally be no longer than 2-pages in length. 1 Page resumes are appropriate for 5 to 7 years expereince. 

Resumes need to be scannable by the HUMAN eye. It should have:

* **Short paragraphs** (no more than 3 to 5 sentences) if you are using a summary format.
* Use **full thoughts** versus full sentences. Be concise and active.
* **No propnouns**. Elminate works like: I, me, my, mine, out, their, etc. 
* **Numbers** - use "10" instead of "ten" as reaers eyes will pick up  numbers before words. When highlighitng accomplisments, use quantifiable reuslts / statistics whenever possible. It helps the reader see them quickly.
*  **Abbreviations** instead of zeros. One million dollars should be written $1M. For one thousand use $1K.
*  **Symbols** are acceptable when they represent percentages (%) and dollars ($).
*  **Keywords** that are market appropriate.

## Font & Font Sizes
* 10.5 font size is the smallest recommended font size.
* The body of the resume shoudl ne no more than 12-point font and no msaller than 10.5 font.
* Headers and your name should be a larger sized font.

### Good Fonts to try:

**Serif Fonts**
	* Georgia
	* Times New Roman
	
	
**Sans Serif Fonts**
	* Calibri
	* Verdana
	* Tahoma


## Commas
Punctuation is important and commas are a common area of concern.

### Recommendations
* Most US-based style guides recommend the use of the serial (aka the Oxford) comma to seperate 3 or more words, phrases or clauses written in a series.
	**EXAMPLE:** Her favorite breakfast consisted of pankcakes, bacon, juice, and eggs.
	
* According to the The Assocated Press Stylebook (2013) leave teh serial comma out, iunless deemed absolutly necessary.
	**EXAMPLE:** Her favorite breakfast consisted of pancakes, backon, juice and eggs. 
	
**Be consistent either way. Always use it or never use it.**
	
	
## Hypenation
This is often cited as one of the most frequent mistakes in writing today. If you are using a 2-word adjective, it's always hyphenated and needs to be consistently presentd throughtout the document. An example would be the term entry-level.
