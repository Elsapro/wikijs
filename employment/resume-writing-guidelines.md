# Resume Writing Strategies & Guidelines
## Overview
* Your resume isn't your "job history" but the part of your job history that is selling you into the role you're targeting.
* Resume reviewers spend less than 10-seconds reviewing a document. A strong personal branding statement helps you quickly get to your messaging.

## Voice & Tense
You are the writer of the resume. That means the resume is written in 1st person, never in 3rd person.

**Example:**
* Correct: Imporved accuracy of cash reporting by 50%
* Incorrect: ~~Improves accurarcy of cash reporting by 50%~~

## Length
Resumes should ideally be no longer than 2-pages in length. 1 Page resumes are appropriate for 5 to 7 years expereince. 

Resumes need to be scannable by the HUMAN eye. It should have:

* **Short paragraphs** (no more than 3 to 5 sentences) if you are using a summary format.
* Use **full thoughts** versus full sentences. Be concise and active. **example**
* **No propnouns**. Elminate works like: I, me, my, mine, out, their, etc. 
* **Numbers** - use "10" instead of "ten" as readers eyes will pick up  numbers before words. When highlighitng accomplisments, use quantifiable results / statistics whenever possible. It helps the reader see them quickly.
*  **Abbreviations** instead of zeros. One million dollars should be written $1M. For one thousand use $1K.
*  **Symbols** are acceptable when they represent percentages (%) and dollars ($).
*  **Keywords** that are market appropriate.

## Font & Font Sizes
* 10.5 font size is the smallest recommended font size.
* The body of the resume should be no more than 12-point font and no smaller than 10.5 font.
* Headers and your name should be a larger sized font.

### Good Fonts to try:

**Serif Fonts**
	* Georgia
	
	
**Sans Serif Fonts**
	* Calibri
	* Verdana
	* Tahoma


## Commas
Punctuation is important and commas are a common area of concern.

### Recommendations
* Most US-based style guides recommend the use of the serial (aka the Oxford) comma to seperate 3 or more words, phrases or clauses written in a series.
	**EXAMPLE:** Her favorite breakfast consisted of pancakes, bacon, juice, and eggs.
	
* According to the The Assocated Press Stylebook (2013) leave the serial comma out, unless deemed absolutely necessary.
	**EXAMPLE:** Her favorite breakfast consisted of pancakes, bacon, juice and eggs. 
	
**Be consistent either way. Always use it or never use it.**
	
	
## Hypenation
This is often cited as one of the most frequent mistakes in writing today. If you are using a 2-word adjective, it's always hyphenated and needs to be consistently presented throughout the document. An example would be the term entry-level.


## Acronyms
If you must use them don't assume non-industry readers will understand what you are referring to.
**Example:** Surpassed Service-Level Agreement (SLA) goals for 2 years running.

# Developing a Summary Profile
Your personal branding statement is often called your "Summary of Qualifications or Profile" section. Adding a branding statement triples your impact, and employers reported that this was one of the very first areas they read. And if the briefly stated summary demonstrates solid ability to fill the advertised job, it catches their attention and they slow down and give the applicant more careful consideration.

Hiring managers also reported only about 5% of resumes contained this key section. Think of it as mini-outline of you: a highly influential summation of the specifics you bring to the job. This section usually consists of four to six sentences that present an overview of your brand identity (i.e. impact, where you add value, your point of differentiation), talents, work habits (i.e. hard and soft skills).


## Elements for an Effective Summary
1. **Your Personal Brand** - Includes the title or position description that describes who you are and your impact, your Unique Selling Point, and / or the benefits you’re offering.

	**EXAMPLE:** High-impact Software Application Architect who leverages IT & Automated Solutions to improve processes and drive cost savings.
	
2. **Hard Skills** - Experience you have in related positions and / or industries and other special technical skills.

	**EXAMPLE:**  Sales strategist with the vision to determine optimal product / services solutions, acquire and develop new business, and successfully penetrate new markets.
	
3. **Soft Skills** - Personal strengths (motivated abilities).

	**EXAMPLE:**   Leverage outstanding relationship management skills to deliver uncompromising customer service and manage high-profile accounts. Experienced with both enterprise class and small business customers using consultative and transactional approaches.


# Accomplishment Statements
> Accomplishment: - An action taken which results in a measurable and beneficial outcome.

## Memory Joggers
Look here for accomplishments:
1. Saved performance reviews
1. Old resumes
1. Things of which you’re very proud (awards / accolades)
1. Past Calendars that document your work efforts
1. Past colleagues input on things you contributed (i.e. where they said you added value)

## Accomplishment Development Questions

1. Did you identify or solve a major problem for your department or division? (Results?)
1. Did you save the company money? (How much?)
1. Did you identify, create or implement a new procedure or system? (Results?)
1. Did you train or develop anyone?
1. Did you develop or do something for the first time at your company? (Results?)
1. Did you accomplish something with fewer resources or in a shorter time?
1. Did you receive any special recognition or awards? (Why?)
1. Did you participate in any recent company sponsored training and apply what you learned?
1. Did you lead or contribute to any special projects? (Results?)
1. Did you suggest or “roll out” any new products or programs?
1. Did you reduce costs, increase revenue / profits or impact bottom-line? (By how much?)
1. Did you increase market share or revenue? (How?)
1. Did you develop new business or enlarge a market? (How?)

## Condensing Language
### Original
* ~~Successfully~~ developed and implemented a new improvement plan for all supply chain teams ~~in the organization. Responsible~~ for providing team member training and standardizing the procedures for ~~all of~~ the deployments. ~~This~~ plan reduced deployment and service times by approximately 25%.
### Better:
* Decreased deployment and service times 25% by developing and implementing supply chain improvement plan, training teams and standardizing deployment procedures.

# Ageless Resume
If you are concerned that you are being screened out because of your age or high level of experience, a good solution is creating an ageless resume. Prospective employers are hiring solutions to problems. You have to demonstrate why you are the solution to the problem.

### Recommendations
1. **Remove mention of tenure in your summary statement**. Example: Instead of saying that you are a project manager with 20 years of experience, write that you are skilled at managing projects for Fortune 500 companies that are delivered on time and under budget. Highlight your **talent** and not your years of experience.
1. **Exclude stating your total number of years of work experience**. As a job candidate, your competitive advantage lies in what you accomplished while working in a function, and not the number of years you worked in that role. What kinds of problems did you solve in the role? How did you cut costs or increase revenue? What systems did you implement that saved time? 
	- **Limit your resume to the most recent 15 years of work experience**. Focus on the most recent 15 years of work experience, which is a good predictor of how you will perform in the future. Your expertise makes you a good hire, so talk about new technologies and current best practices that you have implemented. Consolidate your experience that is beyond 15 years under a heading such as Additional Related Experience and do not include any dates.
	- **Remove graduation dates unless they are recent**. Graduation dates allow hiring managers to roughly calculate your age, so remove any date that will allow them to pinpoint your age. We are living in an age of constant change, and the information you learned while working on your degree 15 years ago is now outdated. However, if you recently completed a degree, go ahead and include it on your resume.
1. **Include professional development details**. If you have updated your skills regularly and/or have completed certification in your industry or functional area, include them to demonstrate that you are a lifelong learner. You can add a section on your resume such as Recent Professional Accomplishments.
1. **Include recent business results**. If you have achieved noteworthy business results, include them on your resume.
# Proofreading Tips
When sending out any document related to your job search, it is critical it be error free.

* Read the copy out loud.
* Read the copy backwards to focus on the spelling of words.
	* Covering the words above and below your line helps you to keep your eye just on the line you are proofreading.
	* When reading one line at a time, and doing it backwards, you don't have the context and meaning to let you know if your eye skips a line.
* Use spell check and grammar check as a first screening, but don't rely on them.
	* There are too many possibilities for error with spell check. (Examples: lead and led, there and their, to
and two, our and hour - words that are correctly spelled but may not be the form you intended.)
* Don't proof for every type of mistake at once -- do one proofreading for spelling, another for consistency of word usage, verb tenses, punctuation, etc.
* Double check little words: "or," "of," "it," and "is" are often interchanged.
* Take a break and come back to it fresh. How often do you find a typo after the fact even when you have proofread the document several times? The wrong spelling can look right until you leave it and come back with fresh eyes.
