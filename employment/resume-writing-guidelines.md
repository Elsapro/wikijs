# Resume Writing Strategies & Guidelines
## Overview
* You reume isn't your "job history" but the part of your job hisotry that is selling you into the role you're targeting.
* Resume reviewers spend less than 10-seconds reciewing a document. A trong personal branding statement helps you quickly get to your messaging.

## Voice & Tense
You are the writer of the resume. That means the resume is written in 1st person, never in 3rd person.

**Example:**
* Correct: Imporved accuracy of cash reporting by 50%
* Incorrect: ~~Improves accurarcy of cash reporting by 50%~~

## Length
Resumes shiould ideally be no longer than 2-pages in length. 1 Page resumes are appropriate for 5 to 7 years expereince. 

Resumes need to be scannable by the HUMAN eye. It should have:

* **Short paragraphs** (no more than 3 to 5 sentences) if you are using a summary format.
* Use **full thoughts** versus full sentences. Be concise and active.
* **No propnouns**. Elminate works like: I, me, my, mine, out, their, etc. 
* **Numbers** - use "10" instead of "ten" as reaers eyes will pick up  numbers before words. When highlighitng accomplisments, use quantifiable reuslts / statistics whenever possible. It helps the reader see them quickly.
*  **Abbreviations** instead of zeros. One million dollars should be written $1M. For one thousand use $1K.
*  **Symbols** are acceptable when they represent percentages (%) and dollars ($).
*  **Keywords** that are market appropriate.

## Font & Font Sizes
* 10.5 font size is the smallest recommended font size.
* The body of the resume shoudl ne no more than 12-point font and no msaller than 10.5 font.
* Headers and your name should be a larger sized font.

### Good Fonts to try:

**Serif Fonts**
	* Georgia
	* Times New Roman
	
	
**Sans Serif Fonts**
	* Calibri
	* Verdana
	* Tahoma


## Commas
Punctuation is important and commas are a common area of concern.

### Recommendations
* Most US-based style guides recommend the use of the serial (aka the Oxford) comma to seperate 3 or more words, phrases or clauses written in a series.
	**EXAMPLE:** Her favorite breakfast consisted of pankcakes, bacon, juice, and eggs.
	
* According to the The Assocated Press Stylebook (2013) leave teh serial comma out, iunless deemed absolutly necessary.
	**EXAMPLE:** Her favorite breakfast consisted of pancakes, backon, juice and eggs. 
	
**Be consistent either way. Always use it or never use it.**
	
	
## Hypenation
This is often cited as one of the most frequent mistakes in writing today. If you are using a 2-word adjective, it's always hyphenated and needs to be consistently presentd throughtout the document. An example would be the term entry-level.

	# Developing a Summary Profile
Your personal branding statement is often called your "Summary of Qualifications or Profile" section. Adding a branding statement triples your impact, and employers reported that this was one of the very first areas they read. And if the briefly stated summary demonstrates solid ability to fill the advertised job, it catches their attention and they slow down and give the applicant more careful consideration.

Hiring managers also reported only about 5% of resumes contained this key section. Think of it as mini-outline of you: a highly influential summation of the specifics you bring to the job. This section usually consists of four to six sentences that present an overview of your brand identity (i.e. impact, where you add value, your point of differentiation), talents, work habits (i.e. hard and soft skills).


## Elements for an Effective Summary
1. **Your Personal Brand** - Includes the title or position description that describes who you are and your impact, your Unique Selling Point, and / or the benefits youâ€™re offering.
2. **Hard Skills** - Experience you have in related positions and / or industries and other special technical skills.

	**EXAMPLE:**  Sales strategist with the vision to determine optimal product / services solutions, acquire and develop new business, and successfully penetrate new markets.

3. **Soft Skills** - Personal strengths (motivated abilities).

	**EXAMPLE:**  Sales strategist with the vision to determine optimal product / services solutions, acquire and develop new business, and successfully penetrate new markets.
