# Cover Letters
The best way to write a cover letter is in direct response to a job posting.  A “Point-By-Point Match” cover letter is crafted to respond specifically to the requirements presented in the job posting.   The cover letter should become the first page of an attached document that is followed by your resume so the reader only needs to open one document.

## Opening
Open the letter with your interest in the role and stree how you can bring value to them.

## Point-by-point comparisons
Add a two column table without any borders and match their posting requirements with your qualifications:

## Closing
Close by referencing resume and plan for follow-up.
> Please refer to my resume for additional accomplishments, and I hope to speak with you as well.  As I know that you are busy, I will plan to follow up.  Thank you for your consideration.
