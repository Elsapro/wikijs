1. Denial 
1. Anger

1. Acceptance 


- **People who grieve do not always go through the stages in the same order or experience all of them.**
##  DENIAL
Denial is the begining stages of grief. It is one of many emotions we go through when faced with a job loss. This is a point in our life when things just fall apart. Nothing makes sense as we try to regain a grip on reality. You fall not only into denial about the situation but also into a state of shock. While you feel yourself becoming numb you can't help but wonder how you are going to survive this? The denial and shock actually help us cope and thus making survival possible.  As you begin to accept the reality of your job loss, you will find yourself asking questions about what's next? This is a sign you are beginning to heal. As you become stronger other feelings you were denying will begin to surface.

##  ANGER
Anger is definately part of the healing process. You can't hide from your anger, it will just make it seem like it will go on forever. They say if you can feel it, and move past it you will begin to heal. This doesn't mean to take it out on anyone else, that's not okay.  Do go down to the  gym and throw some punches at the bag.  Hop on your bike and ride till you get it out of your system.  Meditate till you can find inner peace, for this too shall pass. If you've ever been angey before, and let's face it, who hasn't, we know that anger has no limits. You can find yourself taking it out on not only your friends, but your family, yourself and anyone else foolish enough to be around at this point in your grieving. These people if caught up in your anger will move out of your range to safer ground  leaving you possibly to feel deserted and abandoned in your time of need

##  BARGAINING
You know those first five-ten minutes after your boss dropped the bomb?  Sure you remember them, when you thought you'd  do anything if only you could have your job back.  “Oh please, ” you bargain in your head, “I will never complain about my job again, just don't let me go!”

After a loss, bargaining may take the form of a temporary truce. “What if I devote the rest of my life to helping others. Then can I wake up and realize this has all been a bad dream?” We become lost in a maze of “If only…” or “What if…” statements. We want life returned to what is was; we want our loved one restored. We want to go back in time: find the tumor sooner, recognize the illness more quickly, stop the accident from happening…if only, if only, if only. Guilt is often bargaining’s companion. The “if onlys” cause us to find fault in ourselves and what we “think” we could have done differently. We may even bargain with the pain. We will do anything not to feel the pain of this loss. We remain in the past, trying to negotiate our way out of the hurt. People often think of the stages as lasting weeks or months. They forget that the stages are responses to feelings that can last for minutes or hours as we flip in and out of one and then another. We do not enter and leave each individual stage in a linear fashion. We may feel one, then another and back again to the first one.

##  DEPRESSION
After bargaining, our attention moves squarely into the present. Empty feelings present themselves, and grief enters our lives on a deeper level, deeper than we ever imagined. This depressive stage feels as though it will last forever. It’s important to understand that this depression is not a sign of mental illness. It is the appropriate response to a great loss. We withdraw from life, left in a fog of intense sadness, wondering, perhaps, if there is any point in going on alone? Why go on at all? Depression after a loss is too often seen as unnatural: a state to be fixed, something to snap out of. The first question to ask yourself is whether or not the situation you’re in is actually depressing. The loss of a loved one is a very depressing situation, and depression is a normal and appropriate response. To not experience depression after a loved one dies would be unusual. When a loss fully settles in your soul, the realization that your loved one didn’t get better this time and is not coming back is understandably depressing. If grief is a process of healing, then depression is one of the many necessary steps along the way.

##  ACCEPTANCE
Acceptance is often confused with the notion of being “all right” or “OK” with what has happened. This is not the case. Most people don’t ever feel OK or all right about the loss of a loved one. This stage is about accepting the reality that our loved one is physically gone and recognizing that this new reality is the permanent reality. We will never like this reality or make it OK, but eventually we accept it. We learn to live with it. It is the new norm with which we must learn to live. We must try to live now in a world where our loved one is missing. In resisting this new norm, at first many people want to maintain life as it was before a loved one died. In time, through bits and pieces of acceptance, however, we see that we cannot maintain the past intact. It has been forever changed and we must readjust. We must learn to reorganize roles, re-assign them to others or take them on ourselves. Finding acceptance may be just having more good days than bad ones. As we begin to live again and enjoy our life, we often feel that in doing so, we are betraying our loved one. We can never replace what has been lost, but we can make new connections, new meaningful relationships, new inter-dependencies. Instead of denying our feelings, we listen to our needs; we move, we change, we grow, we evolve. We may start to reach out to others and become involved in their lives. We invest in our friendships and in our relationship with ourselves. We begin to live again, but we cannot do so until we have given grief its time.

-   We would all like to think we are above this process but alas it is not so.
     Often it is hard to identify that we are going through this process on our own.
		 Pay attention to the people around you and how they react to you.
     Listen to what the people around you are saying to you to see if there is any
     merit in their words.
-  Record yourself on your phone.  Do you sound down?  Are your words harsh and angry sounding?
