# Who's on First
No, The 5 stages of grief are: 

1. Denial 
1. Anger
1. Bargaining
1. Depression
1. Acceptance 


- **People who grieve do not always go through the stages in the same order or experience all of them.**
##  DENIAL
Denial is the begining stages of grief. It is one of many emotions we go through when faced with a job loss. This is a point in our life when things just fall apart. Nothing makes sense as we try to regain a grip on reality. You fall not only into denial about the situation but also into a state of shock. While you feel yourself becoming numb you can't help but wonder how you are going to survive this? The denial and shock actually help us cope and thus making survival possible.  As you begin to accept the reality of your job loss, you will find yourself asking questions about what's next? This is a sign you are beginning to heal. As you become stronger other feelings you were denying will begin to surface.

##  ANGER
Anger is definately part of the healing process. You can't hide from your anger, it will just make it seem like it will go on forever. They say if you can feel it, and move past it you will begin to heal. This doesn't mean to take it out on anyone else, that's not okay.  Do go down to the  gym and throw some punches at the bag.  Hop on your bike and ride till you get it out of your system.  Meditate till you can find inner peace, for this too shall pass. If you've ever been angey before, and let's face it, who hasn't, we know that anger has no limits. You can find yourself taking it out on not only your friends, but your family, yourself and anyone else foolish enough to be around at this point in your grieving. These people if caught up in your anger will move out of your range to safer ground  leaving you possibly to feel deserted and abandoned in your time of need. Just remember Rome wasn't built in a day and neither will you push past your anger phase so quickly. 

##  BARGAINING
You know those first five-ten minutes after your boss dropped the bomb?  Sure you remember when you thought you'd  do anything if only he would take back those words, "I'm gonna have to let you go."  “Oh please, ” you bargain in your head, “I will never complain about my job again, just don't let me go!” Sometimes we find ourselves making deals with our Maker. "I promise to never call out sick again to play golf, just make him take it back." "I'll be a better husband/wife/sister/brother." Get the point? We can so easily get caught up in the "What if's" We're locked in this thought that if we can just take a step back we can fix everything.  Suddenly we will see the signs we missed that led to the job loss in the first place. Amazingly we believe we would make the correct choices given a second chance.

##  DEPRESSION
When reality finally starts to set in and we have no choice but to accept the facts we move into the depression. Our thoughts may suddenly appear crystal clear where before we swam in the  pool of uncertainty.  Regret jumps in to help weight  us down in our depression as the harsh words we spoke out in anger come back to haunt us. But wait a minute, I can't be depressed that's for crazy people.  You know, the guy who's one card short of a full deck. Nah, that's not me. Honestly though, losing your job, your livelyhood, career, is a major loss. One of the biggest you will deal with in life, second only to death.  You needn't be ashamed of anything, the job loss, the emotional roller coaster ride. Okay, depending on what you may have said to people in anger you may owe a few people an apology. Someone once said if grief is a process of healing, then depression is one of the many necessary steps along the way.

##  ACCEPTANCE
Acceptance is like Forgiving, it's not done to absolve the othe person for the wrong they did.  Acceptance is a way of acknowledging your pain and all you went through and then allowing yourself to finally move on with your life. Saying goodbye to what once was and looking at the possibilities you couldn't see before. By getting out there and networking you can make new connections, build a strong group of like minded people by joining groups on LinkedIn. You might want to invest in your friendships and in your relationships with family members. As you begin to feel alive again, be thankful that you made it through your grief and can now rise from the ashes like the phoneix.
