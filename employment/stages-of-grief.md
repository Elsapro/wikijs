# Who's on First
No, The 5 stages of grief are: 

1. Denial 
1. Anger
1. Bargaining
1. Depression
1. Acceptance 


- **People who grieve do not always go through the stages in the same order or experience all of them.**
##  DENIAL
Denial is the begining stages of grief. It is one of many emotions we go through when faced with a job loss. This is a point in our life when things just fall apart. Nothing makes sense as we try to regain a grip on reality. You fall not only into denial about the situation but also into a state of shock. While you feel yourself becoming numb you can't help but wonder how you are going to survive this? The denial and shock actually help us cope and thus making survival possible.  As you begin to accept the reality of your job loss, you will find yourself asking questions about what's next? This is a sign you are beginning to heal. As you become stronger other feelings you were denying will begin to surface.

##  ANGER
Anger is definately part of the healing process. You can't hide from your anger, it will just make it seem like it will go on forever. They say if you can feel it, and move past it you will begin to heal. This doesn't mean to take it out on anyone else, that's not okay.  Do go down to the  gym and throw some punches at the bag.  Hop on your bike and ride till you get it out of your system.  Meditate till you can find inner peace, for this too shall pass. If you've ever been angey before, and let's face it, who hasn't, we know that anger has no limits. You can find yourself taking it out on not only your friends, but your family, yourself and anyone else foolish enough to be around at this point in your grieving. These people if caught up in your anger will move out of your range to safer ground  leaving you possibly to feel deserted and abandoned in your time of need. Just remember Rome wasn't built in a day and neither will you push past your anger phase so quickly. 

##  BARGAINING
You know those first five-ten minutes after your boss dropped the bomb?  Sure you remember when you thought you'd  do anything if only he would take back those words, "I'm gonna have to let you go."  “Oh please, ” you bargain in your head, “I will never complain about my job again, just don't let me go!” Sometimes we find ourselves making deals with our Maker. "I promise to never call out sick again to play golf, just make him take it back." "I'll be a better husband/wife/sister/brother." Get the point? We can so easily get caught up in the "What if's" We're locked in this thought that if we can just take a step back we can fix everything.  Suddenly we will see the signs we missed that led to the job loss in the first place. Amazingly we believe we would make the correct choices given a second chance.

##  DEPRESSION
When reality finally starts to set in and we have no choice but to accept the facts we move into the depression. Our thoughts may suddenly appear crystal clear where before we swam in the  pool of uncertainty.  Regret jumps in to help weight  us down in our depression as the harsh words we spoke out in anger come back to haunt us. But wait a minute, I can't be depressed that's for crazy people.  You know, the guy who's one card short of a full deck. Nah, that's not me. Honestly though, losing your job, your livelyhood, career, is a major loss. One of the biggest you will deal with in life, second only to death.  You needn't be ashamed of anything, the job loss, the emotional roller coaster ride. Okay, depending on what you may have said to people in anger you may owe a few people an apology. Someone once said if grief is a process of healing, then depression is one of the many necessary steps along the way.

##  ACCEPTANCE
Acceptance is often confused with the notion of being “all right” or “OK” with what has happened. This is not the case. Most people don’t ever feel OK or all right about the loss of a loved one. This stage is about accepting the reality that our loved one is physically gone and recognizing that this new reality is the permanent reality. We will never like this reality or make it OK, but eventually we accept it. We learn to live with it. It is the new norm with which we must learn to live. We must try to live now in a world where our loved one is missing. In resisting this new norm, at first many people want to maintain life as it was before a loved one died. In time, through bits and pieces of acceptance, however, we see that we cannot maintain the past intact. It has been forever changed and we must readjust. We must learn to reorganize roles, re-assign them to others or take them on ourselves. Finding acceptance may be just having more good days than bad ones. As we begin to live again and enjoy our life, we often feel that in doing so, we are betraying our loved one. We can never replace what has been lost, but we can make new connections, new meaningful relationships, new inter-dependencies. Instead of denying our feelings, we listen to our needs; we move, we change, we grow, we evolve. We may start to reach out to others and become involved in their lives. We invest in our friendships and in our relationship with ourselves. We begin to live again, but we cannot do so until we have given grief its time.

-   We would all like to think we are above this process but alas it is not so.
     Often it is hard to identify that we are going through this process on our own.
		 Pay attention to the people around you and how they react to you.
     Listen to what the people around you are saying to you to see if there is any
     merit in their words.
-  Record yourself on your phone.  Do you sound down?  Are your words harsh and angry sounding?
