The 5 stages of grief and loss are: 

	1. 		Denial and isolation
	1. 		Anger
	1. 		Bargaining
	1. 		Depression
	1. 		Acceptance 


- **People who grieve do not always go through the stages in the same order or experience all of them.**
		
-   We would all like to think we are above this process but alas it is not so.
     Often it is hard to identify that we are going through this process on our own.
		 Pay attention to the people around you and how they react to you.
     Listen to what the people around you are saying to you to see if there is any
     merit in their words.
-  Record yourself on your phone.  Do you sound down?  Are your words harsh and angry sounding?
