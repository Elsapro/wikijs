# The 5 Stages of Grief & Loss
-  The 5 stages of grief and loss are: 
		1. Denial and isolation
		2. Anger
		3. Bargaining
		4. Depression
		5. Acceptance 
		People who are grieving do not necessarily go through the stages in the same order or experience all of them.

-   We would all like to think we are above this process but alas it is not so.
     Often it is hard to identify that we are going through the process on our own.
     Listen to what the people around you are saying to you to see if there is any
     merit in their words.
